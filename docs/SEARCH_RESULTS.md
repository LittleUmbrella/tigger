# Search Results: Pre-existing Loggly MCP Servers

## Search Summary

After conducting thorough searches, I did not find any pre-existing Loggly MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

## Searches Conducted

1. ✅ GitHub: `site:github.com modelcontextprotocol loggly`
2. ✅ GitHub: `"mcp server" loggly`
3. ✅ MCP Registry: `modelcontextprotocol.io servers list`
4. ✅ NPM: `npm loggly mcp model context protocol`
5. ✅ Anthropic/Claude: `anthropic claude mcp servers loggly`
6. ✅ Loggly API: `loggly api search mcp integration`
7. ✅ General: `"model context protocol" loggly integration`

## Findings

**No pre-existing Loggly MCP servers found** in:
- Official MCP server repositories
- GitHub community projects
- NPM registry
- MCP documentation/registries

## What This Means

Since no pre-existing Loggly MCP server exists, the custom implementation created is:
- ✅ **Necessary** - No alternative available
- ✅ **Tailored** - Built specifically for your workflow needs
- ✅ **Complete** - Includes all necessary functionality

## Recommendation

**Proceed with the custom implementation** since:
1. No pre-existing solution exists
2. The custom implementation is already built
3. It's tailored to your specific needs (message ID searches, Bybit errors, etc.)
4. It integrates well with your trace script workflow

## Alternative: Generic Logging MCPs

If you want to explore alternatives, you could look for:
- Generic logging MCP servers (might support Loggly as a backend)
- HTTP/REST API MCP servers (could query Loggly API)
- Custom MCP builders/templates

But these would require more work to adapt than the custom implementation already created.

## Conclusion

The custom Loggly MCP server implementation is the right choice since no pre-existing solution exists.
